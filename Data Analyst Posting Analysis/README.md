With my applying to numerous Data Analyst positions online, I've noticed a trend with the postings such as a large majority of them were from New York City.
This lead me to wonder what other trends these postings can contain. With the data procured from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs), I transformed and analyzed the data to answer questions such as:
<ol> 
<li>Which companies post the most often looking for Data Analysts?</li>
<li>What are the most popular cities for Data Analsts?</li>  
<li>Whats are the most common things sought after in the job descriptions?</li>  
<li>Whats the breakdown of the Data Analyst sector look like?</li>  
<li>What does the annual salary look like?</li>  
    <ol>
    <li>How does the salary range between the cities?</li>
    <li>Does the ratings have an affect on the salary?</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
